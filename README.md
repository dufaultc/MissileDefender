# MissileDefender
This is an old game I created in 2016 using java. The objective is to click the missiles before they reach the city below.
With each missile missed the health of the city drops. If the health of the city falls below zero you lose. There are five
progessively harder levels to the game.

Audio files which go along with the game were omitted for copyright purposes.
